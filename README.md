    <p><small>There isn't much to say. My birthday is August 18, 1993. I graduated UCA in 2015 with my Bachelors in Education. I have a small family of my me, my husband, our daughter, and dog. I'm back in school trying to figure out life. With that being said, I've started taking on a multitude of hobbies but have yet mastered any. I enjoy going running the park, listening to music, and relaxing even though I feel like there's never time. </small></p>
